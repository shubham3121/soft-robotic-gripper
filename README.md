# soft-robotic-gripper

This was my under-graduate final year research project. This project captures the developement of a soft robotic gripper that exhibits the grasping and release action similar to a human hand. The use of NiTi coils as actuators, instead of servo motors, for producing the grasp and release motion, differentiates this robotic gripper from existing ones. This repository consits of:
- source code files for the micro-controller
- Related cad models and gcode files
- Detailed report on the robotic gripper
- A copy of the paper that was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (RAS Society)
- Link to video of the prototype: https://youtu.be/JxMexBUdsPk
